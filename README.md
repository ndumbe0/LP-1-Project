SPRINT PROJECT ON ANALYSIS OF INDIAN STARTUPS TO THE YEAR 2021

This project is a part of the [Data Science Cohort 7  Group](https://www.azubiafrica.org/data-analytics) at(https://www.azubiafrica.org/data-analytics)

 Project Status: [Completed]

Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to first firmiliarise myself with analytical skills I have acquired with them for the period of almost nine months and to get to see what a work environment running a data analytical project would look like outside of the training environment. It would also be to enhance my analaytical skils to best find ways to solve analytical problems that I encounter as I go through a project step by step and also fimiliarisation with  new problem solving programs. The other would be sourcing dat from servers and secured sorces which one can not download from and protecting these sources. The project objective would be introducing me fully to the data analytical work nature and what to expect going forward.

 Project Description
1. Business Understanding
Objective: To understand the funding trends in Indian start-ups from 1982 to 2021 based on various factors such as industry, funding round, and location.

2. Data Understanding
I have a dataset with columns related to start-up funding ranging from the year 1982 to late 2021, which I will use to explore relationships and trends.

HYPOTHESIS:

H1: The average funding amount differs significantly across different industries. (ACCEPTED)

Statistical Test: ANOVA( Which is the analysis of variance ) which will help me in determining  if there are great statistical differences in the amounts across the dataset.


1. Which industries received the highest average funding during 1980-2021?

2. How does the funding round impact the amount of funding received by start-ups?

3. How did the funding amounts in 2020 (during the pandemic) compare to the funding amounts in 2018 and 2019? Did the pandemic lead to a decline or an increase in funding?

4. Which industries experienced the most significant changes in funding before and during the pandemic? Did certain sectors thrive while others struggled?

5. What characteristics ( location) are associated with higher funding amounts?

6. How did the total amount of funding for Indian start-ups change from 2010 to 2021? What are the yearly trends? Did Covid 19 have an impact?
