SPRINT PROJECT ON ANALYSIS OF INDIAN STARTUPS TO THE YEAR 2021

This project is a part of the [Data Science Cohort 7  Group](https://www.azubiafrica.org/data-analytics) at(https://www.azubiafrica.org/data-analytics)

 Project Status: [Completed]

Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to first firmiliarise myself with analytical skills I have acquired with them for the period of almost nine months and to get to see what a work environment running a data analytical project would look like outside of the training environment. It would also be to enhance my analaytical skils to best find ways to solve analytical problems that I encounter as I go through a project step by step and also fimiliarisation with  new problem solving programs. The other would be sourcing dat from servers and secured sorces which one can not download from and protecting these sources. The project objective would be introducing me fully to the data analytical work nature and what to expect going forward.

 Project Description
1. Business Understanding
Objective: To understand the funding trends in Indian start-ups from 1982 to 2021 based on various factors such as industry, funding round, and location.

2. Data Understanding
I have a dataset with columns related to start-up funding ranging from the year 1982 to late 2021, which I will use to explore relationships and trends.

HYPOTHESIS:

H1: The average funding amount differs significantly across different industries. (ACCEPTED)

Statistical Test: ANOVA( Which is the analysis of variance ) which will help me in determining  if there are great statistical differences in the amounts across the dataset.


1. Which industries received the highest average funding during 1980-2021?
![Qn 1 Average Funding by Industry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9afa5a1-be9b-4b5c-bb52-72d7bdfce25d)
This bar plot titled 'Average Funding by Industry (1982-2021)' displays the average funding amount for each industry from 1982 to 2021. The plot shows that the top funded industries include 'Gaming', 'Social Media', 'E-commerce', 'Aerospace', and 'Renewable Energy'.

The 'Gaming' industry has the highest average funding, exceeding 1 billion dollars. The 'Social Media' and 'E-commerce' industries also have high average funding, exceeding 600 million dollars. The 'Aerospace' and 'Renewable Energy' industries have an average funding of over 400 million dollars.

Other industries, as shown in the plot, have average funding amounts ranging from around 100 million dollars to 400 million dollars.

2. How does the funding round impact the amount of funding received by start-ups?

This box plot titled 'Funding Amount by Round/Series' displays the distribution of funding amounts for each funding round/series. 

The plot shows that the 'Series C' funding round has the highest median funding amount, exceeding 200 million dollars. The 'Series D' and 'Series B' funding rounds also have high median funding amounts, exceeding 100 million dollars.

Other funding rounds, as shown in the plot, have median funding amounts ranging from around 10 million dollars to 100 million dollars. The 'Seed' funding round has the lowest median funding amount, less than 10 million dollars.

This bar plot titled 'Average Funding Amount by Round/Series' displays the average funding amount for each funding round/series. 

The plot shows that the 'Series F' funding round has the highest average funding amount, exceeding 400 million dollars. The 'Venture Round' and 'Series E' funding rounds also have high average funding amounts, exceeding 200 million dollars.

Other funding rounds, as shown in the plot, have average funding amounts ranging from around 10 million dollars to 100 million dollars. The 'Seed' funding round has the lowest average funding amount, less than 10 million dollars.

3. How did the funding amounts in 2020 (during the pandemic) compare to the funding amounts in 2018 and 2019? Did the pandemic lead to a decline or an increase in funding?

This bar plot titled 'Total Funding by Year (2018-2020)' displays the total funding amount for each year from 2018 to 2020. 

The plot shows that the year 2018 had the highest total funding, exceeding 2.4 billion dollars. The years 2019 and 2020 have total funding amounts of 1.04 billion dollars and 986 million dollars, respectively.

4. Which industries experienced the most significant changes in funding before and during the pandemic? Did certain sectors thrive while others struggled?

This bar plot titled 'Change in Funding by Industry (Pre vs During Pandemic)' displays the change in funding for each industry before and during the pandemic. 

The plot shows that the industries with the largest increase in funding during the pandemic include 'Gaming', 'Social Media', 'E-commerce', 'Aerospace', and 'Renewable Energy'.

The 'Gaming' industry has the largest increase in funding, exceeding 400 million dollars. The 'Social Media' and 'E-commerce' industries also have significant increases in funding, exceeding 200 million dollars. The 'Aerospace' and 'Renewable Energy' industries have increases in funding exceeding 100 million dollars.

Other industries, as shown in the plot, have either experienced increases or decreases in funding ranging from less than 100 million dollars to over 100 million dollars.

5. What characteristics ( location) are associated with higher funding amounts?

Other industries, as shown in the plot, have total funding amounts ranging from around 100 million dollars to 400 million dollars. The locations with the highest total funding amounts include Bangalore, Mumbai, and Gurugram.

6. How did the total amount of funding for Indian start-ups change from 2010 to 2021? What are the yearly trends? Did Covid 19 have an impact?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2102d15-f50d-41f8-9de9-ffc9c448882b)
This line plot titled 'Total Amount of Funding for Indian Start-ups (1982-2021)' displays the trend of total funding amount by year. 

The plot shows that there was a significant increase in total funding amount from 2014 to 2021, with some fluctuations.

Before 2014, the total funding amount remained relatively low, with a few minor peaks.

In 2014, there was a noticeable jump in total funding, followed by a slight dip in 2015 and subsequent fluctuations until 2020.

The year 2021 saw the highest total funding amount, exceeding 4 billion dollars.
